<p>It is important to take care of the patient, and the patient will be followed,
    but at the same time they occur as a result of great pain and suffering. For
    to come to the smallest detail, no one should practice any kind of work unless
    he derives some benefit from it. Do not be angry with the pain in the rebuke,
    in the pleasure he wants to be a hair from the pain, let him run away from the
    pain. Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come out; they are in fault
    who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is toil.</p>
